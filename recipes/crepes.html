    <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
    <p>Indulge in the French classic, crepes - a thin, delectable pancake that can be filled with endless sweet or
        savory options.</p>
    <p>A versatile and impressive dish that will delight any food lover!</p>

    <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, milk, egg and salt.</li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium high heat. When the pan is hot add a teaspoon of butter and
            lightly coat the surface of the pan with the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour one quarter cup of the batter into the pan and tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter
            coats the surface in a smooth and even layer.</li>
        <li>After two minutes, lift up an edge of the crepe with a spatula to see if it is browning.
            When the underside has begun to brown, flip the crepe and cook the other side until it is also brown; about
            2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
