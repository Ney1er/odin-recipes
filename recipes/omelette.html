    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious breakfast classic is the perfect way to start your day!</p>
    <p>Fluffy eggs, mixed with your favorite ingredients, cooked to perfection and served hot off the pan - what could be better?</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Add if preferred: vegetables, cheese and or meat</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat 2-3 eggs in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add a tablespoon of milk or cream for a creamier texture (optional)</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of butter or oil. Once the butter has melted or the oil is hot, pour in the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Let the eggs cook undisturbed for 30 seconds, then use a spatula to gently push the cooked edges towards the center, allowing the uncooked egg to flow to the edges of the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the top is mostly set but still slightly runny, add your desired fillings (e.g. cheese, vegetables, meat) to one side of the omelette. Use the spatula to fold the other side of the omelette over the fillings and slide it onto a plate. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
